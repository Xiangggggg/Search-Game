Rules (so far):
1. Searcher goal: collect half of the coins
2. Monster goal: kill searcher
3. After each turn, each player can put "light spots" which will reveal
whatever is there. Anything that walks over these light spots (besides the
one who put it) will be visible to the other player, including coins. 
 

Questions:
What is the ratio of coins to size?
What is the ratio of number of moves per turn to size?
Should the monster have more moves than the player?
Should coins be randomly generated or generated in some pattern?
Should player positions be randomly generated?
How many "light spots" can each player put down per turn (based on size of board)?
Should the light spots increase as the number of moves increases?
Should there be a move limit that, when reached, makes the monster win by
default to limit game time?
If the player goes out of boundry, should they be able to reappear on the opposite
side like in those types of games? ex: If I past the bottom boundry, I end up
at the top.
